### About Myself
  
  > Work smarter, not harder 
  
  It all started in 2020. Weight year passed at home. At the time, I didn't know who I would be? And I started to wonder. <br> 
  I tried Photoshop, I wanted to become a web designer. After a while I lost interest in it. Then I watched a video about the development.<br>
  Before that, I knew little about developers. After reading in the forums, watching a bunch of videos, I decided to try myself as a developer.
